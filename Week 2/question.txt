You have a list of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.
Write a function get_products_of_all_ints_except_at_index() that takes a list of integers and returns a list of the products.

For example, given:
[1,7,3,4]
your function should return:
[84,12,28,21]
by calculating:
[7 * 3 * 4 , 1 * 3 * 4 , 1 * 7 * 4 , 1 * 7 * 3]
Here's the catch: You can't use division in your solution!
